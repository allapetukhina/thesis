% \section{Preprocessing of fMRI data}

% \emph{fMRI} data from an \emph{MRI} scanner requires a number of preprocessing operations before the data can be used in further analyses. The final product of this pipeline are the output of time-independent activation coefficients. 


% We are mostly interested in the extraction of activation coefficients from the BOLD timeseries, which is usually considered the last part of the preprocessing pipeline. 

% For completeness, and since these preprocessing routines are a crucial step in the analysis of \emph{fMRI} data, we briefly mention the other e


% As these preprocessing routines are a crucial step in the analysis of \emph{fMRI} data,
% we describe them briefly. However, they will not be further discussed in this
% manuscript.
