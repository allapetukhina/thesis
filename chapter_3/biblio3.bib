abstract = {Identifying brain hemodynamics in event-related functional MRI (fMRI) data is a crucial issue to disentangle the vascular response from the neuronal activity in the BOLD signal. This question is usually addressed by estimating the so-called hemodynamic response function (HRF). Voxelwise or region-/parcelwise inference schemes have been proposed to achieve this goal but so far all known contributions commit to pre-specified spatial supports for the hemodynamic territories by defining these supports either as individual voxels or a priori fixed brain parcels. In this paper, we introduce a joint parcellation-detection-estimation (JPDE) procedure that incorporates an adaptive parcel identification step based upon local hemodynamic properties. Efficient inference of both evoked activity, HRF shapes and supports is then achieved using variational approximations. Validation on synthetic and real fMRI data demonstrate the JPDE performance over standard detection estimation schemes and suggest it as a new brain exploration tool.},

@article{Badillo2013,
abstract = {Inter-subject fMRI analyses have specific issues regarding the reliability of the results concerning both the detection of brain activation patterns and the estimation of the underlying dynamics. Among these issues lies the variability of the hemodynamic response function (HRF), that is usually accounted for using functional basis sets in the general linear model context. Here, we use the joint detection-estimation approach (JDE) (Makni et al., 2008; Vincent et al., 2010) which combines regional nonparametric HRF inference with spatially adaptive regularization of activation clusters to avoid global smoothing of fMRI images. We show that the JDE-based inference brings a significant improvement in statistical sensitivity for detecting evoked activity in parietal regions. In contrast, the canonical HRF associated with spatially adaptive regularization is more sensitive in other regions, such as motor cortex. This different regional behavior is shown to reflect a larger discrepancy of HRF with the canonical model. By varying parallel imaging acceleration factor, SNR-specific region-based hemodynamic parameters (activation delay and duration) were extracted from the JDE inference. Complementary analyses highlighted their significant departure from the canonical parameters and the strongest between-subject variability that occurs in the parietal region, irrespective of the SNR value. Finally, statistical evidence that the fluctuation of the HRF shape is responsible for the significant change in activation detection performance is demonstrated using paired t-tests between hemodynamic parameters inferred by GLM and JDE.},

In this paper, we classify the local minima of LRSDPr and prove the optimal convergence of a slight variant of the successful, yet experimental, algorithm of Burer and Monteiro [6], which handles LRSDPr via the nonconvex change of variables X = RR T. In addition, for particular problem classes, we describe a practical technique for obtaining lower bounds on the optimal solution value during the execution of the algorithm. Computational results are presented on a set of combinatorial optimization relaxations, including some of the largest quadratic assignment SDPs solved to date.},

abstract = {We consider a general class of second-order iterations for unconstrained optimization that includes regularization and trust-region variants of Newton’s method. For each method in this class, we exhibit a smooth, bounded-below objective function, whose gradient is globally Lipschitz continuous within an open convex set containing any iterates encountered and whose Hessian is $\alpha$−H¨ older continuous (for given $\alpha$ ∈ [0, 1]) on the path of the iterates, for which the method in question takes at least ⌊ǫ−(2+$\alpha$)/(1+$\alpha$)⌋ function-evaluations to generate a first iterate whose gradient is smaller than ǫ in norm. This provides a lower bound on the evaluation complexity of second-order methods in our class when applied to smooth problems satisfying our assumptions. Furthermore, for $\alpha$ = 1, this lower bound is of the same order in ǫ as the upper bound on the evaluation complexity of cubic regularization, thus implying cubic regularization has optimal worst-case evaluation complexity within our class of second-order methods. 1},

@article{Ciuciu2003,
abstract = {This paper deals with the estimation of the blood oxygen level-dependent response to a stimulus, as measured in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A precise estimation is essential for a better understanding of cerebral activations. The most recent works have used a nonparametric framework for this estimation, considering each brain region as a system characterized by its impulse response, the so-called hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, the use of these techniques has remained limited since they are not well-adapted to real fMRI data. Here, we develop a threefold extension to previous works. We consider asynchronous event-related paradigms, account for different trial types and integrate several fMRI sessions into the estimation. These generalizations are simultaneously addressed through a badly conditioned observation model. Bayesian formalism is used to model temporal prior information of the underlying physiological process of the brain hemodynamic response. By this way, the HRF estimate results from a tradeoff between information brought by the data and by our prior knowledge. This tradeoff is modeled with hyperparameters that are set to the maximum-likelihood estimate using an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. The proposed unsupervised approach is validated on both synthetic and real fMRI data, the latter originating from a speech perception experiment.},

The amplitudes of the responses as a function of parametrically varied behavioral conditions are fitted well using a piecewise linear approximation. Use of the combined model, in conjunction with correlation analysis, results in an increase in sensitivity for the MRI study. This approach, based on the well-established methods of linear systems analysis, also allows a quantitative comparison of the response amplitudes across subjects to a broad range of behavioral conditions. Fit parameters, derived from the amplitude data, are relatively insensitive to a variety of MRI-related artifacts and yield results that are compared readily across subjects.},

@article{Dale1999,
abstract = {An important challenge in the design and analysis of event-related or single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to optimize statistical efficiency, i.e., the accuracy with which the event-related hemodynamic response to different stimuli can be estimated for a given amount of imaging time. Several studies have suggested that using a fixed inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of at least 15 sec results in optimal statistical efficiency or power and that using shorter ISIs results in a severe loss of power. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ISIs as short as 500 ms while still maintaining considerable efficiency or power. Here, we attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by a quantitative analysis of the relative efficiency afforded by different event-related experimental designs. This analysis shows that statistical efficiency falls off dramatically as the ISI gets sufficiently short, if the ISI is kept fixed for all trials. However, if the ISI is properly jittered or randomized from trial to trial, the efficiency improves monotonically with decreasing mean ISI. Importantly, the efficiency afforded by such variable ISI designs can be more than 10 times greater than that which can be achieved by fixed ISI designs. These results further demonstrate the feasibility of using identical experimental designs with fMRI and electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) without sacrificing statistical power or efficiency of either technique, thereby facilitating comparison and integration across imaging modalities.},

abstract = {A major limitation in conducting functional neuroimaging studies, particularly for cognitive experiments, has been the use of blocked task paradigms. Here we explored whether selective averaging techniques similar to those applied in event-related potential (ERP) experiments could be used to demonstrate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to rapidly intermixed trials. In the first two experiments, we observed that for 1-sec trials of full-field visual checkerboard stimulation, the fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal summated in a roughly linear fashion across successive trials even at very short (2 sec and 5 sec) intertrial intervals, although subtle departures from linearity were observed. In experiments 3 and 4, we observed that it is possible to obtain robust activation maps for rapidly presented randomly mixed trial types (left- and right-hemifield visual checkerboard stimulation) spaced as little as 2 sec apart. Taken collectively, these results suggest that selective averaging may enable fMRI experimental designs identical to those used in typical behavioral and ERP studies. The ability to analyze closely spaced single-trial, or event-related, signals provides for a class of experiments which cannot be conducted using blocked designs. Trial types can be randomly intermixed, and selective averaging based upon trial type and/or subject performance is possible.},

abstract = {An accurate estimation of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for a precise spatial and temporal estimate of the underlying neuronal processes. Recent works have proposed non-parametric estimation of the HRF under the hypotheses of linearity and stationarity in time. Biological literature suggests, however, that response magnitude may vary with attention or ongoing activity. We therefore test a more flexible model that allows for the variation of the magnitude of the HRF with time in a maximum likelihood framework. Under this model, the magnitude of the HRF evoked by a single event may vary across occurrences of the same type of event. This model is tested against a simpler model with a fixed magnitude using information theory. We develop a standard EM algorithm to identify the event magnitudes and the HRF. We test this hypothesis on a series of 32 regions (4 ROIS on eight subjects) of interest and find that the more flexible model is better than the usual model in most cases. The important implications for the analysis of fMRI time series for event-related neuroimaging experiments are discussed.},

abstract = {We consider the predictive problem of supervised ranking, where the task is to rank sets of candidate items returned in response to queries. Although there exist statistical procedures that come with guarantees of consistency in this setting, these procedures require that individuals provide a complete ranking of all items, which is rarely feasible in practice. Instead, individuals routinely provide partial preference information, such as pairwise comparisons of items, and more practical approaches to ranking have aimed at modeling this partial preference data directly. As we show, however, such an approach has serious theoretical shortcomings. Indeed, we demonstrate that many commonly used surrogate losses for pairwise comparison data do not yield consistency; surprisingly, we show inconsistency even in low-noise settings. With these negative results as motivation, we present a new approach to supervised ranking based on aggregation of partial preferences and develop \$U\$-statistic-based empirical risk minimization procedures. We present an asymptotic analysis of these new procedures, showing that they yield consistency results that parallel those available for classification. We complement our theoretical results with an experiment studying the new procedures in a large-scale web-ranking task.},

abstract = {This article proposes a new algorithm to compute the projection on the set of images whose total variation is bounded by a constant. The projection is computed through a dual formulation that is solved by first order non-smooth optimization methods. This yields an iterative algorithm that applies iterative soft thresholding to the dual vector field, and for which we establish convergence rate on the primal iterates. This projection algorithm can then be used as a building block in a variety of applications such as solving inverse problems under a total variation constraint, or for texture synthesis. Numerical results are reported to illustrate the usefulness and potential applicability of our TV projection algorithm on various examples including denoising, texture synthesis, inpainting, deconvolution and tomography problems. We also show that our projection algorithm competes favorably with state-of-the-art TV projection methods in terms of convergence speed.},

abstract = {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating responses in eventrelated fMRI.},

In order to cope with the increase in the number of degrees of freedom, we introduce a Gaussian process prior on the filter parameters. We show how to carry on the analysis by incorporating prior knowledge on the filters, optimizing hyper-parameters using the evidence framework, or sampling using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We present a comparison of our model with standard haemodynamic response kernels on simulated data, and perform a full analysis of data acquired during an experiment involving visual stimulation.},

abstract = {Estimates of hemodynamic response functions (HRF) are often integral parts of event-related fMRI analyses. Although HRFs vary across individuals and brain regions, few studies have investigated how variations affect the results of statistical analyses using the general linear model (GLM). In this study, we empirically estimated HRFs from primary motor and visual cortices and frontal and supplementary eye fields (SEF) in 20 subjects. We observed more variability across subjects than regions and correlated variation of time-to-peak values across several pairs of regions. Simulations examined the effects of observed variability on statistical results and ways different experimental designs and statistical models can limit these effects. Widely spaced and rapid event-related experimental designs with two sampling rates were tested. Statistical models compared an empirically derived HRF to a canonical HRF and included the first derivative of the HRF in the GLM. Small differences between the estimated and true HRFs did not cause false negatives, but larger differences within an observed range of variation, such as a 2.5-s time-to-onset misestimate, led to false negatives. Although small errors minimally affected detection of activity, time-to-onset misestimates as small as 1 s influenced model parameter estimation and therefore random effects analyses across subjects. Experiment and analysis design methods such as decreasing the sampling rate or including the HRF's temporal derivative in the GLM improved results, but did not eliminate errors caused by HRF misestimates. These results highlight the benefits of determining the best possible HRF estimate and potential negative consequences of assuming HRF consistency across subjects or brain regions.},

@article{Haufe2013,
abstract = {The increase in spatiotemporal resolution of neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods. Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but complementary objectives require different analysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses.},

The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely distributed and overlapping.},

Using a first-order Taylor approximation in terms of the temporal derivative of a canonical hemodynamic response function, statistical parametric maps of differential latencies were estimated via the ratio of derivative to canonical parameter estimates. This method was applied to two example datasets: comparison of words versus nonwords in a lexical decision task and initial versus repeated presentations of faces in a fame-judgment task. Tests across subjects revealed both magnitude and latency differences within several brain regions. This approach offers a computationally efficient means of detecting BOLD latency differences over the whole brain. Precise characterization of the hemodynamic latency and its interpretation in terms of underlying neural differences remain problematic, however.},

abstract = {Visual imagery during sleep has long been a topic of persistent speculation, but its private nature has hampered objective analysis. Here we present a neural decoding approach in which machine-learning models predict the contents of visual imagery during the sleep-onset period, given measured brain activity, by discovering links between human functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns and verbal reports with the assistance of lexical and image databases. Decoding models trained on stimulus-induced brain activity in visual cortical areas showed accurate classification, detection, and identification of contents. Our findings demonstrate that specific visual experience during sleep is represented by brain activity patterns shared by stimulus perception, providing a means to uncover subjective contents of dreaming using objective neural measurement.},

abstract = {When inferring the presence of a specific cognitive process from observed brain activation a kind of reasoning is applied that is called reverse inference. Poldrack (2006) rightly criticized the careless use of reverse inference. As a consequence, reverse inference is assumed as intrinsically weak by many and its validity has been increasingly regarded as limited. Although it is undisputed that the careless use of reverse inference is a problematic practice, the current view of reverse inference is to the author's opinion overly pessimistic. The present manuscript provides a revised formulation of reverse inference that includes an additional conditional constraint that has been previously acknowledged, but so far not implemented: the task-setting. This revised formulation I.) reveals that reverse inference can have high predictive power (as demonstrated by an example estimation) and II.) allows an estimation of reverse inference on the basis of meta-analyses instead of large-scale databases. It is concluded that reverse inference cannot be disregarded as a fallacy per se. Rather, the predictive power of reverse inference can even be "decisive"-dependent on the cognitive process of interest, the specific brain region activated, and the task-setting used.},

abstract = {Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has recently received increasing attention in functional neuroimaging due to its ability to decode mental states from fMRI signals. However, questions remain regarding both the empirical and conceptual relationships between results from MVPA and standard univariate analyses. In the current study, whole-brain univariate and searchlight MVPAs of parametric manipulations of monetary gain and loss in a decision making task (Tom et al., 2007) were compared to identify the differences in the results across these methods and the implications for understanding the underlying mental processes. The MVPA and univariate results did identify some overlapping regions in whole brain analyses. However, an analysis of consistency revealed that in many regions the effect size estimates obtained from MVPA and univariate analysis were uncorrelated. Moreover, comparison of sensitivity showed a general trend towards greater sensitivity to task manipulations by MVPA compared to univariate analysis. These results demonstrate that MVPA methods may provide a different view of the functional organization of mental processing compared to univariate analysis, wherein MVPA is more sensitive to distributed coding of information whereas univariate analysis is more sensitive to global engagement in ongoing tasks. The results also highlight the need for better ways to integrate these methods.},

This paper proposes a new step in that direction, with a novel sparse representation for signals belonging to different classes in terms of a shared dictionary andmultiple class-decision functions. The linear variant of the proposedmodel admits a simple probabilistic interpretation, while its most general variant admits an interpretation in terms of kernels. An optimization framework for learning all the components of the proposed model is presented, along with experimental results on standard handwritten digit and texture classification tasks},

abstract = {The potential for human neuroimaging to read out the detailed contents of a person's mental state has yet to be fully explored. We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.},

abstract = {Confirmatory approaches to fMRI data analysis look for evidence for the presence of pre-defined regressors modeling contributions to the voxel time series, including the BOLD response following neuronal activation. As more complicated questions arise about brain function, such as spontaneous and resting-state activity, new methodologies are required. We propose Total Activation (TA) as a novel fMRI data analysis method to explore the underlying activity-inducing signal of the BOLD signal without any timing information that is based on sparse spatio-temporal priors and characterization of the hemodynamic system. Within a variational framework, we formulate a convex cost function-including spatial and temporal regularization terms-that is solved by fast iterative shrinkage algorithms. The temporal regularization expresses that the activity-inducing signal is block-type without restrictions on the timing nor duration. The spatial regularization favors coherent activation patterns in anatomically-defined brain regions. TA is evaluated using a software phantom and an event-related fMRI experiment with prolonged resting state periods disturbed by visual stimuli. The results illustrate that both block-type and spike-type activity can be recovered successfully without prior knowledge of the experimental paradigm. Further processing using hierarchical clustering shows that the activity-inducing signals revealed by TA contain information about meaningful task-related and resting-state networks, demonstrating good abilities for the study of non-stationary dynamics of brain activity.},

abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

abstract = {Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data allows one to make inferences about the architecture of distributed networks in the brain, in terms of effective connectivity. fMRI data are usually acquired using echo planar imaging (EPI). EPI sequences typically acquire slices at different times over a few seconds. DCM, in its original inception, was not informed about these slice timings and assumed that all slices were acquired simultaneously. It has been shown that DCM can cope with slice timing differences of up to 1 s. However, many fMRI studies employ a repetition time (TR) of 3 to 5 s, which precludes a straightforward DCM of these data. We show that this limitation can be overcome easily by including slice timing in the DCM. Using synthetic data we show that the extended DCM furnishes veridical posterior means, even if there are large slice-timing differences. Model comparisons show that, in general, the extended DCM out-performs the original model. We contrast the modeling of slice timing, in the context of DCM, with the less effective approach of 'slice-timing correction', prior to modeling. We apply our procedure to real data and show that slice timings are important parameters. We conclude that, generally, one should use DCM with slice timing.},

Recent studies have characterized the representational geometry of neural population codes by means of representational distance matrices, enabling researchers to compare representations across stages of processing and to test cognitive and computational theories. Representational geometry provides a useful intermediate level of description, capturing both the information represented in a neuronal population code and the format in which it is represented. We review recent insights gained with this approach in perception, memory, cognition, and action. Analyses of representational geometry can compare representations between models and the brain, and promise to explain brain computation as transformation of representational similarity structure.},

abstract = {Brain state decoding or "mind reading" via multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a popular focus of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In brain decoding, stimulus presentation rate is increased as fast as possible to collect many training samples and obtain an effective and reliable classifier or computational model. However, for extremely rapid event-related experiments, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals evoked by adjacent trials are heavily overlapped in the time domain. Thus, identifying trial-specific BOLD responses is difficult. In addition, voxel-specific hemodynamic response function (HRF), which is useful in MVPA, should be used in estimation to decrease the loss of weak information across voxels and obtain fine-grained spatial information. Regularization methods have been widely used to increase the efficiency of HRF estimates. In this study, we propose a regularization framework called mixed L2 norm regularization. This framework involves Tikhonov regularization and an additional L2 norm regularization term to calculate reliable HRF estimates. This technique improves the accuracy of HRF estimates and significantly increases the classification accuracy of the brain decoding task when applied to a rapid event-related four-category object classification experiment. At last, some essential issues such as the impact of low-frequency fluctuation (LFF) and the influence of smoothing are discussed for rapid event-related experiments.},

abstract = {Machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have in the past years developed to become a working horse in brain imaging and the computational neurosciences, as they are instrumental for mining vast amounts of neural data of ever increasing measurement precision and detecting minuscule signals from an overwhelming noise floor. They provide the means to decode and characterize task relevant brain states and to distinguish them from non-informative brain signals. While undoubtedly this machinery has helped to gain novel biological insights, it also holds the danger of potential unintentional abuse. Ideally machine learning techniques should be usable for any non-expert, however, unfortunately they are typically not. Overfitting and other pitfalls may occur and lead to spurious and nonsensical interpretation. The goal of this review is therefore to provide an accessible and clear introduction to the strengths and also the inherent dangers of machine learning usage in the neurosciences.},

abstract = {We present a reduction framework from ordinal ranking to binary classification. The framework consists of three steps: extracting extended examples from the original examples, learning a binary classifier on the extended examples with any binary classification algorithm, and constructing a ranker from the binary classifier. Based on the framework, we show that a weighted 0/1 loss of the binary classifier upper-bounds the mislabeling cost of the ranker, both error-wise and regret-wise. Our framework allows not only the design of good ordinal ranking algorithms based on well-tuned binary classification approaches, but also the derivation of new generalization bounds for ordinal ranking from known bounds for binary classification. In addition, our framework unifies many existing ordinal ranking algorithms, such as perceptron ranking and support vector ordinal regression. When compared empirically on benchmark data sets, some of our newly designed algorithms enjoy advantages in terms of both training speed and generalization performance over existing algorithms. In addition, the newly designed algorithms lead to better cost-sensitive ordinal ranking performance, as well as improved listwise ranking performance.},

@article{Lindquist2009a,
abstract = {Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies.},

abstract = {In Penny et al. [Penny, W., Ghahramani, Z., Friston, K.J. 2005. Bilinear dynamical systems. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 360(1457) 983-993], a particular case of the Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs) was used to model the dynamic behavior of the BOLD response in functional MRI. This state-space model, called bilinear dynamical system (BDS), is used to deconvolve the fMRI time series in order to estimate the neuronal response induced by the different stimuli of the experimental paradigm. The BDS model parameters are estimated using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm proposed by Ghahramani and Hinton [Ghahramani, Z., Hinton, G.E. 1996. Parameter Estimation for Linear Dynamical Systems. Technical Report, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto]. In this paper we introduce modifications to the BDS model in order to explicitly model the spatial variations of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) in the brain using a non-parametric approach. While in Penny et al. [Penny, W., Ghahramani, Z., Friston, K.J. 2005. Bilinear dynamical systems. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 360(1457) 983-993] the relationship between neuronal activation and fMRI signals is formulated as a first-order convolution with a kernel expansion using basis functions (typically two or three), in this paper, we argue in favor of a spatially adaptive GLM in which a local non-parametric estimation of the HRF is performed. Furthermore, in order to overcome the overfitting problem typically associated with simple EM estimates, we propose a full Variational Bayes (VB) solution to infer the BDS model parameters. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model which is able to estimate both the neuronal activity and the haemodynamic response function in every voxel of the brain. We first examine the behavior of this approach when applied to simulated data with different temporal and noise features. As an example we will show how this method can be used to improve interpretability of estimates from an independent component analysis (ICA) analysis of fMRI data. We finally demonstrate its use on real fMRI data in one slice of the brain.},

@article{Makni2008a,
abstract = {Within-subject analysis in fMRI essentially addresses two problems, i.e., the detection of activated brain regions in response to an experimental task and the estimation of the underlying dynamics, also known as the characterisation of Hemodynamic response function (HRF). So far, both issues have been treated sequentially while it is known that the HRF model has a dramatic impact on the localisation of activations and that the HRF shape may vary from one region to another. In this paper, we conciliate both issues in a region-based joint detection-estimation framework that we develop in the Bayesian formalism. Instead of considering function basis to account for spatial variability, spatially adaptive General Linear Models are built upon region-based non-parametric estimation of brain dynamics. Regions are first identified as functionally homogeneous parcels in the mask of the grey matter using a specific procedure [Thirion, B., Flandin, G., Pinel, P., Roche, A., Ciuciu, P., Poline, J.-B., August 2006. Dealing with the shortcomings of spatial normalization: Multi-subject parcellation of fMRI datasets. Hum. Brain Mapp. 27 (8), 678-693.]. Then, in each parcel, prior information is embedded to constrain this estimation. Detection is achieved by modelling activating, deactivating and non-activating voxels through mixture models within each parcel. From the posterior distribution, we infer upon the model parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Bayesian model comparison allows us to emphasize on artificial datasets first that inhomogeneous gamma-Gaussian mixture models outperform Gaussian mixtures in terms of sensitivity/specificity trade-off and second that it is worthwhile modelling serial correlation through an AR(1) noise process at low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. Our approach is then validated on an fMRI experiment that studies habituation to auditory sentence repetition. This phenomenon is clearly recovered as well as the hierarchical temporal organisation of the superior temporal sulcus, which is directly derived from the parcel-based HRF estimates.},

@article{Mumford2012,
abstract = {Use of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to predict the cognitive state of a subject during task performance has become a popular focus of fMRI studies. The input to these analyses consists of activation patterns corresponding to different tasks or stimulus types. These activation patterns are fairly straightforward to calculate for blocked trials or slow event-related designs, but for rapid event-related designs the evoked BOLD signal for adjacent trials will overlap in time, complicating the identification of signal unique to specific trials. Rapid event-related designs are often preferred because they allow for more stimuli to be presented and subjects tend to be more focused on the task, and thus it would be beneficial to be able to use these types of designs in MVPA analyses. The present work compares 8 different models for estimating trial-by-trial activation patterns for a range of rapid event-related designs varying by interstimulus interval and signal-to-noise ratio. The most effective approach obtains each trial's estimate through a general linear model including a regressor for that trial as well as another regressor for all other trials. Through the analysis of both simulated and real data we have found that this model shows some improvement over the standard approaches for obtaining activation patterns. The resulting trial-by-trial estimates are more representative of the true activation magnitudes, leading to a boost in classification accuracy in fast event-related designs with higher signal-to-noise. This provides the potential for fMRI studies that allow simultaneous optimization of both univariate and MVPA approaches.},

@article{Naselaris2011,
abstract = {Over the past decade fMRI researchers have developed increasingly sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear classification, a simple technique for decoding information about experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based encoding model, which describes the information about the stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations: encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in practice these two operations are often confused, and their respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear. Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate some of the most common questions about how information is represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding model can in principle provide a complete functional description of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.},

abstract = {Many behavioral paradigms involve temporally overlapping sensory, cognitive, and motor components within a single trial. The complex interplay among these factors makes it desirable to separate the components of the total response without assumptions about shape of the underlying hemodynamic response. We present a method that does this. Four conditions were studied in four subjects to validate the method. Two conditions involved rapid event-related studies, one with a low-contrast (5\%) flickering checkerboard and another with a high-contrast (95\%) checkerboard. In the third condition, the same high-contrast checkerboard was presented with widely spaced trials. Finally, multicomponent trials were formed from temporally adjacent low-contrast and high-contrast stimuli. These trials were presented as a rapid event-related study. Low-contrast stimuli presented in isolation (partial trials) made it possible to uniquely estimate both the low-contrast and high-contrast responses. These estimated responses matched those measured in the first three conditions, thereby validating the method. Nonlinear interactions between adjacent low-contrast and high-contrast responses were shown to be significant but weak in two of the four subjects.},

abstract = {Medical images can be used to predict a clinical score coding for the severity of a disease, a pain level or the complexity of a cognitive task. In all these cases, the predicted variable has a natural order. While a standard classifier discards this information, we would like to take it into account in order to improve prediction performance. A standard linear regression does model such information, however the linearity as- sumption is likely not be satisfied when predicting from pixel intensities in an image. In this paper we address these modeling challenges with a supervised learning procedure where the model aims to order or rank im- ages. We use a linear model for its robustness in high dimension and its possible interpretation. We show on simulations and two fMRI datasets that this approach is able to predict the correct ordering on pairs of im- ages, yielding higher prediction accuracy than standard regression and multiclass classification techniques.},

The general linear model (GLM) allows to estimate the activation from a design matrix and a fixed hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, the HRF is known to vary substantially between subjects and brain regions. In this paper, we propose a model for jointly estimating the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the activation patterns via a low-rank representation of task effects.This model is based on the linearity assumption behind the GLM and can be computed using standard gradient-based solvers. We use the activation patterns computed by our model as input data for encoding and decoding studies and report performance improvement in both settings.},

One particular practice that has become common is 'reverse inference', by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region. Such inferences are not deductively valid, but can still provide some information. Using a Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database, I characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference. Its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest. I argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference, particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak.},

abstract = {The number of high-dimensional datasets recording multiple aspects of a single phenomenon is increasing in many areas of science, accompanied by a need for mathematical frameworks that can compare multiple large-scale matrices with different row dimensions. The only such framework to date, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), is limited to two matrices. We mathematically define a higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD) for N≥2 matrices D(i)∈R(m(i) × n), each with full column rank. Each matrix is exactly factored as D(i)=U(i)$\Sigma$(i)V(T), where V, identical in all factorizations, is obtained from the eigensystem SV=V$\Lambda$ of the arithmetic mean S of all pairwise quotients A(i)A(j)(-1) of the matrices A(i)=D(i)(T)D(i), i≠j. We prove that this decomposition extends to higher orders almost all of the mathematical properties of the GSVD. The matrix S is nondefective with V and $\Lambda$ real. Its eigenvalues satisfy $\lambda$(k)≥1. Equality holds if and only if the corresponding eigenvector v(k) is a right basis vector of equal significance in all matrices D(i) and D(j), that is $\sigma$(i,k)/$\sigma$(j,k)=1 for all i and j, and the corresponding left basis vector u(i,k) is orthogonal to all other vectors in U(i) for all i. The eigenvalues $\lambda$(k)=1, therefore, define the "common HO GSVD subspace." We illustrate the HO GSVD with a comparison of genome-scale cell-cycle mRNA expression from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and human. Unlike existing algorithms, a mapping among the genes of these disparate organisms is not required. We find that the approximately common HO GSVD subspace represents the cell-cycle mRNA expression oscillations, which are similar among the datasets. Simultaneous reconstruction in the common subspace, therefore, removes the experimental artifacts, which are dissimilar, from the datasets. In the simultaneous sequence-independent classification of the genes of the three organisms in this common subspace, genes of highly conserved sequences but significantly different cell-cycle peak times are correctly classified.},

@article{Riera2004,
abstract = {In this paper, a new procedure is presented which allows the estimation of the states and parameters of the hemodynamic approach from blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses. The proposed method constitutes an alternative to the recently proposed Friston [Neuroimage 16 (2002) 513] method and has some advantages over it. The procedure is based on recent groundbreaking time series analysis techniques that have been, in this case, adopted to characterize hemodynamic responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work represents a fundamental improvement over existing approaches to system identification using nonlinear hemodynamic models and is important for three reasons. First, our model includes physiological noise. Previous models have been based upon ordinary differential equations that only allow for noise or error to enter at the level of observation. Secondly, by using the innovation method and the local linearization filter, not only the parameters, but also the underlying states of the system generating responses can be estimated. These states can include things like a flow-inducing signal triggered by neuronal activation, de-oxyhemoglobine, cerebral blood flow and volume. Finally, radial basis functions have been introduced as a parametric model to represent arbitrary temporal input sequences in the hemodynamic approach, which could be essential to understanding those brain areas indirectly related to the stimulus. Hence, thirdly, by inferring about the radial basis parameters, we are able to perform a blind deconvolution, which permits both the reconstruction of the dynamics of the most likely hemodynamic states and also, to implicitly reconstruct the underlying synaptic dynamics, induced experimentally, which caused these states variations. From this study, we conclude that in spite of the utility of the standard discrete convolution approach used in statistical parametric maps (SPM), nonlinear BOLD phenomena and unspecific input temporal sequences must be included in the fMRI analysis.},

abstract = {The time-frequency and time-scale communities have recently developed a large number of overcomplete waveform dictionaries—stationary wavelets, wavelet packets, cosine packets, chirplets, and warplets, to name a few. Decomposition into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), matching pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB). Basis pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an “optimal” superpo- sition of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coef- ficients among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interest- ing relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, abstract harmonic analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising. BP in highly overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only because of recent advances in linear and quadratic programming by interior-point methods. We obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method and conjugate- gradient solver.},

We propose a straightforward linear Gaussian approach, where decoding relies on the inversion of properly regularized encoding models, which can still be solved analytically. In order to test our approach we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data under a rapid event-related design in which subjects were presented with handwritten characters. Our approach is shown to yield state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived characters as estimated from BOLD responses. This even holds for previously unseen characters. We propose that this framework serves as a baseline with which to compare more sophisticated models for which analytical inversion is infeasible.},

abstract = {Functional imaging studies examining the neural correlates of risk have mainly relied on paradigms involving exposure to simple chance gambles and an economic definition of risk as variance in the probability distribution over possible outcomes. However, there is little evidence that choices made during gambling tasks predict naturalistic risk-taking behaviors such as drug use, extreme sports, or even equity investing. To better understand the neural basis of naturalistic risk-taking, we scanned participants using fMRI while they completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task, an experimental measure that includes an active decision/choice component and that has been found to correlate with a number of naturalistic risk-taking behaviors. In the task, as in many naturalistic settings, escalating risk-taking occurs under uncertainty and might be experienced either as the accumulation of greater potential rewards, or as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value). We found that areas previously linked to risk and risk-taking (bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were activated as participants continued to inflate balloons. Interestingly, we found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity decreased as participants further expanded balloons. In light of previous findings implicating the vmPFC in value calculation, this result suggests that escalating risk-taking in the task might be perceived as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value) rather than the increasing potential total reward relative to the starting point of the trial. A better understanding of how neural activity changes with risk-taking behavior in the task offers insight into the potential neural mechanisms driving naturalistic risk-taking.},

Recently, however, paradigms have been studied in which the converse operation is performed, thus inferring behavioral or mental states associated with activation images. Here, we use the well-known retinotopy of the visual cortex to infer the visual content of real or imaginary scenes from the brain activation patterns that they elicit. We present two decoding algorithms: an explicit technique, based on the current knowledge of the retinotopic structure of the visual areas, and an implicit technique, based on supervised classifiers. Both algorithms predicted the stimulus identity with significant accuracy. Furthermore, we extend this principle to mental imagery data: in five data sets, our algorithms could reconstruct and predict with significant accuracy a pattern imagined by the subjects.},

This provides a reduction in the number of variables that need to be entered into the optimization. In this paper, we propose strong rules that are not foolproof but rarely fail in practice. These are very simple, and can be complemented with simple checks of the KarushKuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to ensure that the exact solution to the convex problem is delivered. These rules oﬀer a substantial savings in both computational time and memory, for a variety of statistical optimization problems},

abstract = {People typically exhibit greater sensitivity to losses than to equivalent gains when making decisions. We investigated neural correlates of loss aversion while individuals decided whether to accept or reject gambles that offered a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money. A broad set of areas (including midbrain dopaminergic regions and their targets) showed increasing activity as potential gains increased. Potential losses were represented by decreasing activity in several of these same gain-sensitive areas. Finally, individual differences in behavioral loss aversion were predicted by a measure of neural loss aversion in several regions, including the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex.},

@article{Turner2012,
abstract = {Despite growing interest in multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods for fMRI, a major problem remains--that of generating estimates in rapid event-related (ER) designs, where the BOLD responses of temporally adjacent events will overlap. While this problem has been investigated for methods that reduce each event to a single parameter per voxel (Mumford et al., 2012), most of these methods make strong parametric assumptions about the shape of the hemodynamic response, and require exact knowledge of the temporal profile of the underlying neural activity. A second class of methods uses multiple parameters per event (per voxel) to capture temporal information more faithfully. In addition to enabling a more accurate estimate of ER responses, this allows for the extension of the standard classification paradigm into the temporal domain (e.g., Mour\~{a}o-Miranda et al., 2007). However, existing methods in this class were developed for use with block and slow ER data, and there has not yet been an exploration of how to adapt such methods to data collected using rapid ER designs. Here, we demonstrate that the use of multiple parameters preserves or improves classification accuracy, while additionally providing information on the evolution of class discrimination. Additionally, we explore an alternative to the method of Mour\~{a}o-Miranda et al. tailored to use in rapid ER designs that yields equivalent classification accuracies, but is better at unmixing responses to temporally adjacent events. The current work paves the way for wider adoption of spatiotemporal classification analyses, and greater use of MVPA with rapid ER designs.},

abstract = {The ill-posed nature of the MEG (or related EEG) source localization problem requires the incorporation of prior assumptions when choosing an appropriate solution out of an infinite set of candidates. Bayesian approaches are useful in this capacity because they allow these assumptions to be explicitly quantified using postulated prior distributions. However, the means by which these priors are chosen, as well as the estimation and inference procedures that are subsequently adopted to affect localization, have led to a daunting array of algorithms with seemingly very different properties and assumptions. From the vantage point of a simple Gaussian scale mixture model with flexible covariance components, this paper analyzes and extends several broad categories of Bayesian inference directly applicable to source localization including empirical Bayesian approaches, standard MAP estimation, and multiple variational Bayesian (VB) approximations. Theoretical properties related to convergence, global and local minima, and localization bias are analyzed and fast algorithms are derived that improve upon existing methods. This perspective leads to explicit connections between many established algorithms and suggests natural extensions for handling unknown dipole orientations, extended source configurations, correlated sources, temporal smoothness, and computational expediency. Specific imaging methods elucidated under this paradigm include the weighted minimum l(2)-norm, FOCUSS, minimum current estimation, VESTAL, sLORETA, restricted maximum likelihood, covariance component estimation, beamforming, variational Bayes, the Laplace approximation, and automatic relevance determination, as well as many others. Perhaps surprisingly, all of these methods can be formulated as particular cases of covariance component estimation using different concave regularization terms and optimization rules, making general theoretical analyses and algorithmic extensions/improvements particularly relevant.},

@article{Woolrich2004,
abstract = {FMRI modelling requires flexible haemodynamic response function (HRF) modelling, with the HRF being allowed to vary spatially and between subjects. To achieve this flexibility, voxelwise parameterised HRFs have been proposed; however, inference on such models is very slow. An alternative approach is to use basis functions allowing inference to proceed in the more manageable General Linear Model (GLM) framework. However, a large amount of the subspace spanned by the basis functions produces nonsensical HRF shapes. In this work we propose a technique for choosing a basis set, and then the means to constrain the subspace spanned by the basis set to only include sensible HRF shapes. Penny et al. showed how Variational Bayes can be used to infer on the GLM for FMRI. Here we extend the work of Penny et al. to give inference on the GLM with constrained HRF basis functions and with spatial Markov Random Fields on the autoregressive noise parameters. Constraining the subspace spanned by the basis set allows for far superior separation of activating voxels from nonactivating voxels in FMRI data. We use spatial mixture modelling to produce final probabilities of activation and demonstrate increased sensitivity on an FMRI dataset.},

abstract = {Estimation and inferences for the hemodynamic response functions (HRF) using multi-subject fMRI data are considered. Within the context of the General Linear Model, two new nonparametric estimators for the HRF are proposed. The first is a kernel-smoothed estimator, which is used to construct hypothesis tests on the entire HRF curve, in contrast to only summaries of the curve as in most existing tests. To cope with the inherent large data variance, we introduce a second approach which imposes Tikhonov regularization on the kernel-smoothed estimator. An additional bias-correction step, which uses multi-subject averaged information, is introduced to further improve efficiency and reduce the bias in estimation for individual HRFs. By utilizing the common properties of brain activity shared across subjects, this is the main improvement over the standard methods where each subject's data is usually analyzed independently. A fast algorithm is also developed to select the optimal regularization and smoothing parameters. The proposed methods are compared with several existing regularization methods through simulations. The methods are illustrated by an application to the fMRI data collected under a psychology design employing the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task.},

abstract = {A semi-parametric model for estimating hemodynamic response function (HRF) from multi-subject fMRI data is introduced within the context of the General Linear Model. The new model assumes that the HRFs for a fixed brain voxel under a given stimulus share the same unknown functional form across subjects, but differ in height, time to peak, and width. A nonparametric spline-smoothing method is developed to evaluate this common functional form, based on which subject-specific characteristics of the HRFs can be estimated. This semi-parametric model explicitly characterizes the common properties shared across subjects and is flexible in describing various brain hemodynamic activities across different regions and stimuli. In addition, the temporal differentiability of the employed spline basis enables an easy-to-compute way of evaluating latency and width differences in hemodynamic activity. The proposed method is applied to data collected as part of an ongoing study of socially mediated emotion regulation. Comparison with several existing methods is conducted through simulations and real data analysis.},

abstract = {We study how closely the optimal Bayes error rate can be approximately reached using a classification algorithm that computes a classifier by minimizing a convex upper bound of the classification error function. The measurement of closeness is characterized by the loss function used in the estimation. We show that such a classification scheme can be generally regarded as a (nonmaximum-likelihood) conditional in-class probability estimate, and we use this analysis to compare various convex loss functions that have appeared in the literature. Furthermore, the theoretical insight allows us to design good loss functions with desirable properties. Another aspect of our analysis is to demonstrate the consistency of certain classification methods using convex risk minimization. This study sheds light on the good performance of some recently proposed linear classification methods including boosting and support vector machines. It also shows their limitations and suggests possible improvements.},
