    abstract = {{While medical imaging typically provides massive amounts of data, the extraction of relevant information for predictive diagnosis remains a difficult challenge. Functional MRI (fMRI) data, that provide an indirect measure of taskrelated or spontaneous neuronal activity, are classically analyzed in a mass-univariate procedure yielding statistical parametric maps. This analysis framework disregards some important principles of brain organization: population coding, distributed and overlapping representations. Multivariate pattern analysis, i.e., the prediction of behavioural variables from brain activation patterns better captures this structure. To cope with the high dimensionality of the data, the learning method has to be regularized. However, the spatial structure of the image is not taken into account in standard regularization methods, so that the extracted features are often hard to interpret. More informative and interpretable results can be obtained with the '1 norm of the image gradient, a.k.a. its Total Variation (TV), as regularization. We apply for the first time this method to fMRI data, and show that TV regularization is well suited to the purpose of brain mapping while being a powerful tool for brain decoding. Moreover, this article presents the first use of TV regularization for classification.}},

@inproceedings{Borghesani2014,
abstract = {The application of multivariate approaches to neuroimaging data analysis is providing cognitive neuroscientists with a new perspective on the neural substrate of conceptual knowledge. In this paper we show how the combined use of decoding models and of representational similarity analysis (RSA) can enhance our ability to investigate the inter-categorical distinctions as well as the intra-categorical similarities of neural semantic representations. By means of a linear decoding model, we have been able to predict the category of the words subjects were seeing while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) acquisition. Moreover, RSA in anatomically defined region of interest (ROIs) revealed a significant correlation with length of words and real item size in primary and secondary visual areas (V1 and V2), while a semantic distance effect was significant in inferotemporal areas (BA37 and BA20). Together, these findings illustrate the possibility to decode the distinctive neural patterns of semantic categories and to investigate the peculiar aspects of the neural representations of each single category. We have in fact been able to show a significant correlation between cognitive and neural semantic distance and to describe the gradient of information coding that characterizes the ventral path: from purely perceptual to purely conceptual. These results would not have been possible without a double exploration of the same dataset by means of decoding models and RSA},
